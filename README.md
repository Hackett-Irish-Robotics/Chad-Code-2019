## ChadBot Modules

Using this repository to add a module/system at a time for testing.

We will use this repository for code leading to the bag day and then decide how to proceed from there.

If you are adding a new system module or command, please create a branch for your work. 

Do not commit to master unless code is reviewed and approved by docrea and xavier.
